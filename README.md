# Money Math
## Description

This will be a budget application built in election with the goal of decreasing my monthly budget time and allow me to share my workflow with friends.

Topics to improve upon in this project:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Typescript
4. PostgreSQL

## Why?
I have a specific budget method that requires a lot of tracking and I would like to make an application that follows my workflow but does the heavy lifting for me.

## Current State
Will be started after [Dashboard](https://github.com/LalleyDev/Dashboard) is finished. 

Once finished the plan is to make this into a fully packaged application so I can share it with friends.

## Contributing
Any recommendations are more than welcome as I am trying to learn.
